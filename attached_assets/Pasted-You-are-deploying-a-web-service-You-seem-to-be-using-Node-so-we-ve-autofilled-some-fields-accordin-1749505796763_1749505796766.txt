Root DirectoryOptional
If set, Render runs commands from this directory instead of the repository root. Additionally, code changes outside of this directory do not trigger an auto-deploy. Most commonly used with a monorepo.

e.g. src
Build Command
Render runs this command to build your app before each deploy.

$
npm install; npm run build

Secret Files
Store plaintext files containing secret data (such as a .env file or a private key).
Access during builds and at runtime from your app's root, or from /etc/secrets/<filename>.

Add Secret File
Disk
Mount an SSD to persist your service's filesystem data across deploys. This prevents zero-downtime deploys. Learn More.

Disks are charged at $0.25/GB per month.

Health Check Path
Provide an HTTP endpoint path that Render messages periodically to monitor your service. Learn More.

/healthz
Pre-Deploy Command
Render runs this command before the start command. Useful for database migrations and static asset uploads.

Auto-Deploy
By default, Render automatically deploys your service whenever you update its code or configuration. Disable to handle deploys manually. Learn more.
